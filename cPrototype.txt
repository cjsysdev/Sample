Function prototype tells compiler about number of parameters function takes, data-types of parameters and return type of function.
By using this information, compiler cross checks function parameters and their data-type with function definition and function call.
If we ignore function prototype, program may compile with warning, and may work properly.
But some times, it will give strange output and it is very hard to find such programming mistakes.
Above program checks existence of file, provided from command line, if given file is exist, then the program prints “file exist”, otherwise it prints appropriate error message.
Let us provide a filename, which does not exist in file system, and check the output of program on x86_64 architecture.
